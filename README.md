# General Info and Technologies
I created a dynamic web application that implements CRUD functionality using Java, Hibernate, Spring MVC, Maven and several other technologies. The application allows for users to create an account and manage their own personal planner. The user interface consists of a calendar where users can plan and create events ahead of time.
